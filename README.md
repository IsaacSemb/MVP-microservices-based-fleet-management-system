# MVP Microservices-Based Fleet Management System

Welcome to the MVP Microservices-Based Fleet Management System! This project is part of a dissertation aimed at demonstrating the viability of using a **microservices architecture** as opposed to a monolithic architecture. The project is also designed for personal learning and future advancements.

## Services Overview

The following microservices have been included in this project: 

1. **Driver Service**  
   - Stores driver details.
   - Manages driver-related logic, such as availability.

2. **Vehicle Service**  
   - Stores vehicle data.
   - Handles vehicle-related logic, including availability.

3. **Assignment Service**  
   - Manages the logic of assigning drivers to vehicles.
   - Handles sorting of driver and vehicle availability.

4. **Maintenance Service**  
   - Responsible for routine maintenance, repairs, and predictive maintenance logic.

5. **Scheduling Service**  
   - Builds schedules for all timeline operations.

6. **Fuel Consumption Service**  
   - Manages and logs fuel consumption and related data.

7. **Tasks Service**  
   - Manages all granular tasks carried out daily by the fleet.

**More services and features may be added in the future as the project evolves.**
